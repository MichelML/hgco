# How it works  
_hgco_ simply have a look at your current branch name, and if it contains a JIRA issue key, it adds it at the end of your commit message.  
  
In any other case, _hgco_ throws and your commit is cancelled.  
  
# Install  
```  
npm install -g hgco  
```  

# How to use  
```
hgco -m 'your commit message'
```
